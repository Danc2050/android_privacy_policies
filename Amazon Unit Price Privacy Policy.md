 ## Amazon Unit Price: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Amazon Unit Price for Chrome!

This is an extension by Daniel Connelly. The extension is also available on Firefox.

As an avid Chrome user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when extensions collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this extension to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (e.g., extension preferences) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the extension's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the extension

The list of permissions required by the extension:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `activeTab` | Our extension requires the activeTab permission to interact with the content of the active tab when the user activates the extension, typically through a click on the extension's icon. This interaction includes injecting content scripts that enhance the user's browsing experience on Amazon by providing immediate access to price comparisons and unit prices without altering the webpage's functionality or collecting any personal data. The activeTab permission ensures our extension operates within a context explicitly initiated by the user, maintaining privacy and security. |
| `scripting` | The scripting permission is required for our extension to programmatically inject scripts into Amazon web pages that the user is actively viewing. These injected scripts are crucial for modifying the page's content to display additional information like unit prices and product comparisons. This functionality activates only when the user engages with the extension, ensuring it is a user-driven action. The scripts do not modify the underlying functionality of the webpage nor collect any personal information, focusing solely on enhancing the user's shopping experience by providing valuable insights and comparisons. |
| `host permission` | The host permissions requested by our extension are essential for its operation on Amazon web pages. These permissions enable the extension to apply content scripts specifically to Amazon's domain, allowing us to extract product information such as prices, units, and product images directly from the pages the user visits. This process is crucial for enabling the core functionality of providing unit price comparisons and does not involve tracking user behavior or collecting personal information. |
