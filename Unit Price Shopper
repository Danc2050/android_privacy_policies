 ## Unit Price Shopper: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Unit Price Shopper for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari

This is an extension by Daniel Connelly.

As an avid Chrome user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when extensions collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this extension to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (e.g., extension preferences) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the extension's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the extension

The list of permissions required by the extension:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `storage` | Storing user preferences such as auto-popup, weight unit, volume unit, how many pages to scan, etc. |
| `sidePanel` | Allowing the popup data to persist in a side panel |
| `host permission` | The host permissions requested by our extension are essential for its operation on Amazon, Walmart, and Albertsons' brand web pages. These permissions enable the extension to apply content scripts specifically to Amazon, Walmart, and Albertson' brand domains, allowing us to extract product information such as prices, units, and product images directly from the pages the user visits. This process is crucial for enabling the core functionality of providing unit price comparisons and does not involve tracking user behavior or collecting personal information. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Daniel Connnelly
